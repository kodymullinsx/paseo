# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Paseo is a mobile app for monitoring and controlling your local AI coding agents from anywhere. Your dev environment, in your pocket.

**Key features:**
- Real-time streaming of agent output
- Voice commands for hands-free interaction
- Push notifications when tasks complete
- Multi-agent orchestration across projects

**Not a cloud sandbox** - Paseo connects directly to your actual development environment. Your code stays on your machine.

**Supported agents:** Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode.

## Monorepo Structure

This is an npm workspace monorepo:

- **packages/server**: The Paseo daemon that runs on your machine. Manages agent processes, provides WebSocket API for real-time streaming, and exposes an MCP server for agent control.
- **packages/app**: Cross-platform client (Expo). Connects to one or more servers, displays agent output, handles voice input, and sends push notifications.
- **packages/website**: Marketing site at paseo.dev (TanStack Router + Cloudflare Workers).

## Environment overrides

- `PASEO_HOME` – path for runtime state such as `agents.json`. Defaults to `~/.paseo`; set this to a unique directory (e.g., `~/.paseo-blue`) when running a secondary server instance.
- `PASEO_PORT` – preferred voice server + MCP port. Overrides `PORT` and defaults to `6767`. Use distinct ports (e.g., `7777`) for blue/green testing.

Example blue/green launch:

```
PASEO_HOME=~/.paseo-blue PASEO_PORT=7777 npm run dev
```

## Running and checking logs

Both the server and Expo app are running in a Tmux session. See CLAUDE.local.md for system-specific session details.

## Android

Take screenshots like this: `adb exec-out screencap -p > screenshot.png`

## Testing with Playwright MCP

**CRITICAL:** When asked to test the app, you MUST use the Playwright MCP connecting to Metro at `http://localhost:8081`.

Use the Playwright MCP to test the app in Metro web. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081` to interact with the app UI.

**Important:** Do NOT use browser history (back/forward). Always navigate by clicking UI elements or using `browser_navigate` with the full URL. The app uses client-side routing and browser history navigation breaks the state.

## Expo troubleshooting

Run `npx expo-doctor` to diagnose version mismatches and native module issues.

## Orchestrator Mode

- **When agent control tool calls fail**, make sure you list agents before trying to launch another one. It could just be a wait timeout.
- **Always prefix agent titles** so we can tell which ones are running under you (e.g., "🎭 Feature Implementation", "🎭 Design Discussion").
- **Launch agents in the most permissive mode**: Use full access or bypass permissions mode.
- **Set cwd to the repository root** - The agent's working directory should usually be the repo root


**CRITICAL: ALWAYS RUN TYPECHECK AFTER EVERY CHANGE.**

## NEVER DO THESE THINGS

- **NEVER restart the Paseo daemon/server** - The daemon is running in Tmux and managed by the user. Restarting it disrupts active sessions, loses state, and breaks workflows. If there's a connectivity issue, investigate the cause - do not restart.
- **NEVER kill or restart processes in Tmux** without explicit user permission
- **NEVER assume a timeout means the service needs restarting** - Timeouts can be transient network issues, not service failures
