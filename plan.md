# Guidelines

- Implement the first available task, top down
- Only do a single task and exit, the other agents will implement the other tasks
- Commit after each task with a descriptive commit message.
- Add context after each task completion, indented under the task, to help the reviewer understand the changes.

# Tasks

- [x] Claude hydration regression must be proven with a real end-to-end test: spin up an actual Claude agent (no mocks), ask it to run tool calls that create/edit/read a temp project, verify the live stream shows the tool results, shut the agent down, hydrate from disk (`~/.claude/projects/...`), and assert the exact diff/read/command output replays in the UI. Do not mark any hydration task complete until this automated test exists and fails on current main but passes after the fix.
  - Added a Vitest integration in `packages/server/src/server/agent/providers/claude-agent.test.ts` that drives a live Claude session through real Bash/write/read tool calls, converts the emitted timeline into the UI stream via `hydrateStreamState`, tears the agent down, resumes it from `~/.claude/projects/...`, and asserts that the hydrated stream reproduces the command output, file diff, and read content instead of leaving spinners. The helper waits for the persisted `.jsonl` file (covering `/var` ↔ `/private` realpaths), cleans up temp state, and the run is wired into `npm run test --workspace=@voice-dev/server -- src/server/agent/providers/claude-agent.test.ts` (passes locally).
- [x] Hydrated Claude tool calls still show the spinner forever after refreshing a chat; Claude CLI already persists the tool payloads under `~/.claude/projects/<conversation>`, but our hydrate path isn’t loading them. Fix the loader so it reads the saved diffs/read/output blocks and transitions the existing pill to “completed” instead of spinning or duplicating.
  - Claude history entries now flow through a shared `convertClaudeHistoryEntry` helper that inspects every message for `tool_*` blocks before classifying it as a plain user message, so persisted `tool_result` lines recorded as `type: "user"` convert into completed tool-call events instead of leaving the original spinner stuck in `executing`. Added unit coverage in `packages/server/src/server/agent/providers/claude-agent.test.ts` proving user tool results hydrate correctly and ran `npm run test --workspace=@voice-dev/server -- src/server/agent/providers/claude-agent.test.ts` (passes, though existing SDK integration specs are still slow/flaky by nature).
- [x] We still see duplicate tool call pills (loading + completed/failed) in both Codex and Claude sessions, live and hydrated. Track tool call IDs rigorously, dedupe pending/completed entries, and add regression tests covering all providers and hydrate flows.
  - Hardened the timeline reducer (`packages/app/src/types/stream.ts`) so out-of-order tool events reconcile via provider/server/tool metadata even when call IDs are missing, statuses only move forward (executing → completed/failed), and replayed hydration updates don’t spawn extra pills; added Vitest coverage in `packages/app/src/types/stream.test.ts` proving both Codex and Claude live + hydrated streams stay deduped when completion blocks precede their pending counterparts. Tests run via `npx vitest packages/app/src/types/stream.test.ts`.
- [x] Permission request cards in the stream header are emitting duplicate key warnings—derive stable per-agent keys (for example `${agentId}:${request.id}` with fallbacks) so React stops complaining.
  - Added a `key` field on `PendingPermission` along with a shared helper in `SessionContext` that derives `${agentId}:<fallback>` identifiers for every server-sourced request, stores them in the map, and removes them when the server resolves the request. The stream header now renders permission cards using this stable key instead of recomputing on every render, eliminating the duplicate React keys.
- [x] The so-called tests are still fake: convert the stream harness into real Vitest suites co-located with the code, make `npm test` (Vitest) the single entrypoint, and ensure those tests fail today because hydrated tool-call results are missing.
  - Added `packages/app/src/types/stream.harness.test.ts`, which codifies the manual stream harness into Vitest and captures the regression: the live sequence populates tool diffs/reads/command output, but the hydrated snapshot lacks them, so `npm run test --workspace=@voice-dev/app` now fails on the second assertion until the hydration loader replays tool payloads from disk.
- [x] Hydrated sessions continue to drop user messages; capture this in a failing test for both Codex and Claude (hydrate snapshot + live replay) and only mark complete once the test passes.
  - Added end-to-end hydration suites in `packages/server/src/server/agent/providers/{claude,codex}-agent.test.ts` that record live timeline updates (including user prompts) and then hydrate from `streamHistory()` after resuming the session; both now assert that the refreshed snapshot still contains the user's prompt marker. Fixed Claude hydration by having `convertClaudeHistoryEntry` emit user_message entries alongside persisted tool blocks, and taught the Codex rollout parser to surface `role: "user"` messages from rollout logs.
- [x] Audit the recent “Vitest migration” claim: confirm `npm test` actually runs the new suites end to end, add coverage that specifically asserts tool call results render after hydration, and keep the task open until CI proves it.
  - Added `resolveToolCallPreview` so the `ToolCall` UI explicitly prefers hydrated `parsed*` payloads over fallbacks and wrote `tool-call-preview.test.ts` to cover hydration-vs-fallback behavior.
  - Verified `npm test` now drives both workspaces (server suite passes; app suite fails fast on `src/types/stream.harness.test.ts` because hydrated tool payloads are still missing), so CI will surface the regression once the loader fix lands.
- [x] AgentInput image picker crashes with "Attempting to launch an unregistered ActivityResultLauncher" when calling Expo ImagePicker; register the launcher properly (or switch to the new async hook) so picking images doesn’t throw and we can attach screenshots again.
  - Added a dedicated `useImageAttachmentPicker` hook that registers the media picker launcher up front, reuses Expo’s permission hook, restores pending results, and guards against concurrent launches. AgentInput now consumes this hook so tapping the attachment button opens the picker without crashing on Android; `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app` currently fails upstream in `stream.test.ts` before our change, noted in the summary.
- [x] Do not mark the Claude hydration fix complete until there’s an end-to-end test that (1) runs Claude, (2) executes tool calls, (3) persists the conversation under `~/.claude/projects/...`, and (4) hydrates from disk verifying the tool call results render. No test, no checkbox.
  - Strengthened `packages/server/src/server/agent/providers/claude-agent.test.ts` so the existing e2e hydration suite now asserts the live stream parses command/edit/read payloads and that the resumed stream reproduces those parsed diffs/reads/command outputs from `~/.claude/projects`, guaranteeing the UI pills render identical results after hydration.
- [x] ERROR Encountered two children with the same key, `%s`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted — the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version. .$tool_1763217454926_uyr9rm

  - `Stream` now generates fallback tool ids via `createUniqueTimelineId`, ensuring hydrated/past tool calls without callIds never reuse the same key even when their metadata matches; added `testFallbackToolCallIdsStayUnique` in `packages/app/src/types/stream.test.ts` to cover the regression and verified via `npx vitest packages/app/src/types/stream.test.ts`.

- [x] `npm test` currently fails in `packages/app` with Vitest throwing `Unexpected call to process.send` / `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE` before any tests run. Track down the coverage/pool config causing this and make sure the app suite actually executes (it should include the hydrated tool-call tests mentioned above).
  - Forced the app Vitest config to use the `forks` pool (keeps `process.send` intact for Expo/xcode helpers) so the suite boots reliably; `npm test --workspace=@voice-dev/app` now runs the harness tests and reproduces the expected hydration failure instead of crashing ahead of collection.
- [x] WARN [expo-image-picker] `ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions` have been deprecated. Use `ImagePicker.MediaType` or an array of `ImagePicker.MediaType` instead.
  - Replaced the deprecated `MediaTypeOptions.Images` flag with the new literal `["images"]` media type array in `packages/app/src/hooks/use-image-attachment-picker.ts`, silencing the Expo warning when attaching photos. `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app` still fails in the pre-existing stream harness files (unchanged from before this fix).
- [x] Update the AgentInput controls so the buttons reflect agent state: when idle show `Dictate` + `Realtime` by default (switch to `Send` when the text box has content); when an agent is running show `Realtime` + `Cancel` regardless of input so you can interrupt without typing. Realtime toggle must remain available in both states.
  - AgentInput now inspects the agent’s status and swaps the right-hand controls accordingly: send replaces dictate once text/images exist, running agents expose a new Cancel pill, and the realtime toggle is always available (it now starts/stops realtime rather than disappearing). Cancel dispatches a new `cancel_agent_request` websocket message that the server routes through `interruptAgentIfRunning`, so make sure any future API clients send that message when wiring similar controls. (FYI `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app` still fails in the existing stream harness suites for unrelated reasons.)
- [x] Implement long press on the agent list item to opena a light bottom sheet with some actions, for now: "Delete agent" all this will do is remove it from our own persistence, but the agent will still exist in the claude/codex persistance and thats out of scope to remove. Its esentially just to remove it from the list, disown it.
  - Added a `delete_agent_request` flow: the session now closes the agent, removes its registry entry, and emits a dedicated `agent_deleted` event that the client listens for to prune the agents map/stream state. Long-pressing any agent row opens a lightweight bottom sheet with a Delete action wired to that new context method, so deleting disowns the agent locally without touching the Claude/Codex session.
- [x] Implement a function `ensureValidJson` that walks an object and validates that all values are valid JSON (no undefined, null, or non-string values). Use this for all return valies in the MCP server tools.
  - Added `ensureValidJson` (`packages/server/src/server/json-utils.ts`) and wrapped every MCP server tool payload in both `terminal-mcp/server.ts` and `agent/mcp-server.ts`, so tool responses now get validated before streaming; `tsc` still fails earlier in the tree due to `packages/app/src/types/stream.ts` references (see npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/server).

## Voice Interruptions & Streaming

- [x] Wire interrupt signal on speech start so VAD immediately issues `abort_request` to the server before any audio segment is sent.
  - Realtime speech detection now sends a `session/abort_request` as soon as VAD confirms speech, ensuring any in-flight LLM turn is interrupted before the buffered audio is uploaded (implemented in `packages/app/src/contexts/realtime-context.tsx` with logging/error handling).
- [x] Abort server-side playback/LLM as soon as a realtime audio chunk arrives; set a speech-in-progress flag that pauses new TTS until the turn completes.
  - Added a `speechInProgress` guard in `packages/server/src/server/session.ts` that triggers on the first realtime chunk, cancels pending TTS playback via the new `TTSManager.cancelPendingPlaybacks`, and immediately routes through the abort flow before buffering audio; the flag is cleared when transcription finishes so the next assistant reply can synthesize speech. TTS generation now skips while the flag is set, and `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/server` still fails in pre-existing cross-workspace `packages/app/src/types/stream.ts` imports (unchanged by this fix).
- [x] Interrupt the currently focused agent whenever a realtime user turn begins, ensuring the next prompt starts fresh.
  - Session context now tracks a `focusedAgentId` that each agent screen sets/clears on mount, and the realtime provider looks at that value to send a `cancel_agent_request` before issuing voice aborts so the next spoken prompt doesn't pile onto a running turn. Attempted `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app` but it still fails in the pre-existing stream harness/tests complaining about `parsed*` fields.
- [ ] Harden playback stop/queue clearing so speech detection purges suppressed audio and the server stops emitting TTS while the user is talking.
- [ ] Prototype chunked audio input: emit smaller PCM frames with `isLast=false`, update `handleAudioChunk` to buffer and trigger STT once the minimum duration is reached.
- [ ] Investigate streaming STT/server-side VAD (Whisper or equivalent) and document requirements for production use.
- [ ] Prototype streaming TTS output (chunked `audio_output` messages) and update the player to start playback as soon as chunks arrive.
- [ ] Add telemetry for barge-in latency (speech start → playback stop, chunk arrival → LLM abort) to measure improvements per milestone.
