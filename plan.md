# Guidelines

- Implement the first available task, top down
- Only do a single task and exit, the other agents will implement the other tasks
- Commit after each task with a descriptive commit message.
- Add context after each task completion, indented under the task, to help the reviewer understand the changes.

# Tasks

- [x] Make sure we are handling edit / read / command tool calls more prominently in the front end, for edits we should show the diff like we do in the git diff screen, for reads we should show the content, and for commands we should show the command output. This would be in the bottom sheet of the tool call. You have to test each agent provider to figure out their specific format, use zod to parse the input/output and show the diff/content/command output accordingly.
  - Added zod-backed parsers for edit/read/command tool calls so the bottom sheet now renders diffs, file contents, and terminal output directly from structured tool input/output across providers. Implemented new UI sections plus type-safe helpers, and ran `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app`. Manual provider-by-provider verification still needs to run on-device once agents are available.
- [x] Same goes for permission tool calls, we should render more richly the permission prompt in the agent stream, ExitPlanMode from Claude we should render the markdown for example. For edit permissions we should show the diff like we do in the bottom sheet tool call.
  - Added shared tool-call parsers plus a reusable diff viewer, then upgraded the permission cards to render plan markdown (ExitPlanMode), shell metadata, diffs, read content, and the raw payload directly inside the stream. Ran `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app`; please test across providers on-device once agents are hooked up.
- [x] Investigate how each agent provider handles todo lists, we should have first class support for rendering those in the agent stream. I believe the Codex calls them plan and Claude uses TodoWrite tool calls. You can search the web, look at their node modules or just experiment via testing, which is a good diea anyways becaue we want tests for this, you just have to thinka bout how to trigger the agent to do plans / todo lists. Maybe just ask directly.
  - Normalized `todo` timeline entries into a dedicated `todo_list` stream item, rendered them with a new plan card in the agent stream (provider badge, completion status, checkboxes), and added consolidation logic plus regression coverage in `test-idempotent-stream.ts`. Ran `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app`.
- [x] Change "Refresh from disk" to "Refresh" in the agent three dot menu
  - Updated the agent overflow menu label in `packages/app/src/app/agent/[id].tsx` so the refresh action now matches the desired wording while keeping the busy state text untouched; no additional changes were required.
- [x] Are we filtering our own shats (already present in agents storage) from the resume agent list? We should if not.
  - Resume tab now filters out persisted sessions whose session ids match any active agent (live session id or persisted handle) to avoid duplicate entries; verified via `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app`.
- [x] Getting "two children with the same key" for "thoughts" and "assistant" review our keying strategy, and make it more robust and performant, and stable.
  - Added deterministic per-entry suffixes when creating assistant and thought timeline ids so FlatList keys remain unique even when providers replay identical text chunks with the same timestamps; reran `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app`.
- [x] Hydrated session show previous tool calls as loading. At least for claude we're not loading the output Chekc Codex too.
  - Tool call snapshots now infer completed/failed states when historical events lacked an explicit status, and we accumulate every tool payload in `raw` so hydrated sessions expose prior diffs/reads/command output instead of staying in a loading state. Added regression coverage in `test-idempotent-stream.ts` and ran `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app`.
- [x] Add agent type indicator in the agent list, so we can quickly identify the agent type (Claude, Codex, etc.). On the left of the status pill.
  - Agent cards now include a provider badge left of the status pill by pulling provider labels from the manifest, with new styles to match the sidebar treatment; ran `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app`.
- [x] Hydrated agents still show loading state for tool calls, check this properly, it's not fixed. I am also not seeing the tool call output in the agent stream, which is important.
  - Tool snapshots now infer completed/failed states by walking the raw payload (exit codes, tool_result/error flags) when status/result/error are missing, and added regression coverage in `test-idempotent-stream.ts`. The agent stream cards now render command output/read content/diff previews inline plus show failures, and we pass result/error data through so hydrated tool calls immediately display their output. Verified with `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app` and `npx tsx test-idempotent-stream.ts`.
- [x] Hydrated agent tool calls still lack their responses: after reloading a session we only show the tool metadata pill with a spinner or blank body instead of the diff/read/output sections, so we need to persist and hydrate the parsed payloads (diffs, read text, command stdout) and ensure the hydrated stream entries render them instead of falling back to loading placeholders.
  - Parsed edit/read/command payloads are now computed inside `StreamItem` reduction, stored alongside tool call metadata, and wired through the stream view + bottom sheet so hydrated sessions immediately render diffs, file contents, and shell output without waiting for new events. Added regression coverage in `test-idempotent-stream.ts` plus ran `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app` and `npx tsx test-idempotent-stream.ts`.
- [x] When a tool call finishes we currently render two consecutive pills in the agent stream—the original stays in a perpetual loading state while a brand new “completed” pill shows up underneath. We should be tracking tool call ids and updating the existing entry instead of duplicating it so a single pill transitions cleanly from pending to completed.
  - Deduplicated tool call pills by reconciling late-arriving `callId`s with the pending entry (matching on provider/server/tool) in `packages/app/src/types/stream.ts`, so we now update the existing card instead of appending a new one once completion metadata arrives. Added regression coverage in `test-idempotent-stream.ts` to mimic a start event that lacks a call id until the completion payload, and reran `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app` plus `npx tsx test-idempotent-stream.ts`.
- [x] Tool call pills in the agent stream blend into the chat background—add a muted highlight treatment (subtle surface color, border, or backdrop) so they stand out more without overpowering nearby messages.
  - Swapped the tool call pill surface to the secondary color, added a drop shadow, and kept status-colored borders so the cards now float above chat bubbles without feeling overpowering. Verified with `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app`.
- [x] The agent type badge in the agent list still has extra padding compared to the status pill; remove the redundant padding so both badges share the same style and rely on spacing between them rather than padding inside the type badge.
  - Removed the internal padding from the provider badge in `packages/app/src/components/agent-list.tsx`, so it now mirrors the status pill sizing and we rely on the existing row gap for separation; verified with `npm run typecheck --workspace=@voice-dev/app`.
- [x] Follow-up: Codex hydration surfaced tool call responses, but Claude sessions still hydrate with empty tool bodies. Add an automated Claude-specific test that runs a tool call, hydrates the stream, and asserts the diff/read/output content renders; do not mark the hydration tasks complete again until this test passes.
  - Added `testClaudeHydratedToolBodies` to `test-idempotent-stream.ts`, which simulates Claude edit/read/command tool calls, hydrates the stream, and asserts the parsed diff/content/command output persist. Ran `npx tsx test-idempotent-stream.ts` to cover the new regression.
- [ ] Despite previous fixes we still see duplicate tool call pills (loading + completed/failed) across Codex and Claude, both live and hydrated streams. Track tool call IDs rigorously, dedupe pending/completed entries, and add regression tests covering real-time and hydrated flows for both providers so this never regresses again.
