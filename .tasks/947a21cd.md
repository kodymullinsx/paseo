## Notes

**2026-01-11T15:25:05.187Z**

User wants simplified spacing logic; reduce prop drilling without losing functionality.

**2026-01-11T15:28:57.437Z**

Added MessageOuterSpacingProvider context so stream view no longer passes disableOuterSpacing into each message; components now read spacing override from context.

**2026-01-11T15:29:14.746Z**

Simplified spacing by context: message components read disableOuterSpacing from MessageOuterSpacingProvider; AgentStreamView wraps FlatList and no longer prop-drills.
